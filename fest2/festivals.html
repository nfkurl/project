      <h2>An Introduction to Ghanaian Festivals</h2>
      <p>Festivals in Ghana are vibrant, multi-day celebrations that serve as a bridge between the physical and spiritual worlds. Far from being just social gatherings, they are essential rituals of ancestral veneration, historical preservation, and social cohesion.</p>
      <p>During these times, the air is filled with the sound of "talking drums," and the streets are transformed by seas of colorful Kente and Adinkra cloths.</p>
