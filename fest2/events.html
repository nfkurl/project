    <h2>What to Expect at a Ghanaian Festival</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>Event Descriptions</h3>
      <h4>Royal Procession</h4>
      <p>When chiefs travel through town they are carried in richly decorated palanquins — wooden seats raised on poles and borne by honed attendants. Bright ceremonial umbrellas hover above each chief as a symbol of office and protection; the umbrellas, patterned cloths and the chief's regalia flash in the sun while drummers signal the cortege's movement. The procession moves with deliberate dignity: steps, pauses, salutes and offerings mark the pathway.</p>

      <h4>Sacred Drumming</h4>
      <p>Drumming is the heartbeat of the festival. Talking drums (hourglass-shaped drums whose pitch changes when squeezed) send messages across the crowd, imitating speech patterns and calling different groups to action. A circle of drummers keeps complex polyrhythms, while lead drummers and horn players cue dancers, rituals and transitions from one ceremony to the next.</p>

      <h4>The Grand Durbar</h4>
      <p>The durbar is the grand assembly where chiefs, elders and dignitaries gather in public. Chiefs sit in state on raised platforms, receive salutations, and make formal addresses; it is both ceremonial and a living forum for community matters. Expect speeches, formalities, prayers, and public honours — the atmosphere balances solemn respect with communal celebration.</p>

      <h3>A Typical 3‑Day Timeline</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Day 1 — Private and Family Rituals</strong>
          <p>Small, intimate rites take place in family compounds and at shrines: libations, offerings to ancestors, and cleansing rites. These preparations set the spiritual tone for the public festivities.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Day 2 — Public Street Processions</strong>
          <p>Color and movement fill the streets. Processions of chiefs, drummers, and dance troupes parade through neighborhoods. Markets and open‑air stages host performances; visitors can watch cloth displays, traditional dances and receive informal invitations to join the dances.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Day 3 — The Grand Durbar & Communal Feast</strong>
          <p>The culminating durbar brings everyone together: formal greetings, public pronouncements, and a large communal meal. This is the moment of shared celebration and public thanksgiving.</p>

      <h3>Festival Etiquette</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dress:</strong> Wear respectful, colorful attire. Traditional textiles like Kente and Adinkra are welcomed and show appreciation — modesty and neatness are important.</li>
        <li><strong>Photos:</strong> Always ask before photographing chiefs, priests, or sacred rites. Some moments are private or sacred and should not be recorded.</li>
        <li><strong>Greetings:</strong> Offer a warm, respectful greeting — a handshake with slight bow or a verbal greeting in the local language if you know one (for example, "Akwaaba" for welcome). Follow the lead of elders during ceremonies.</li>
        <li><strong>Participation:</strong> Join dances and drumming only when invited. If you are offered food or a seat, accept with thanks — acceptance often symbolizes community inclusion.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Communal Feast</h3>
      <p>Food is the festival's social glue. Sharing a communal meal affirms bonds between families and the wider community. For example, at Homowo the traditional dish <em>Kpokpoi</em> (a steamed millet or maize dish often served with palm nut soup) is central to the feast and the ritual giving of thanks for the harvest. Visitors are usually invited to share in the meal — accepting food and eating together is a way to show respect and become part of the celebration.</p>
